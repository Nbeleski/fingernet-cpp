## FingerNet inference in C++
---

### Introduction
---

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the FingerNet minutiae detection model using Openvino, including all the required pre- and post-processing. The purpose of this repository is to showcase the pipeline from a Python model (in this case, TensorFlow) to a C++ dynamic library. This enables its use in any application capable of loading a .dll/.so file.

Please note that I have not included links to any external dependencies, such as Openvino and OpenCV, or build instructions as this implementation primarily serve as a personal reference for myself.
